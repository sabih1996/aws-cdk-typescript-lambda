# Build your Lambda with Typescript using AWS CDK

_Infrastructure as code framework used_: AWS CDK
_AWS Services used_: AWS Lambda, AWS DynamoDB

## Summary of the demo

In this demo you will see:

- How to use Typescript in your Lambda functions and how to deploy it easily using AWS CDK

## Requirements

- AWS CLI already configured with Administrator permission
- AWS CDK - v2
- NodeJS 14.x installed
- CDK bootstrapped in your account

## Deploy this demo

Deploy the project to the cloud:

```
cdk synth
cdk bootstrap

- `npm run watch` watch for changes and compile
- `npm run test` perform the jest unit tests
